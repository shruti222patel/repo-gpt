The OpenAI Five Benchmark match will be heldÂ 12:30pm Pacific Time on August 5Â in San Francisco. The human team will includeÂ Blitz,Â Cap,Â Fogged, andÂ Merlini, some of whom are former professionals. The games will be streamed on ourÂ TwitchÂ channel andÂ castedÂ by popular castersÂ PurgeÂ andÂ ODPixel.Last year ourÂ preliminary Dota systemÂ defeated the worldâs top professionals at the 1v1 version of Dota; last month OpenAI Five started defeating amateur teams at the full game of Dota (with someÂ restrictions). This event will show whether we have any hope of reaching the level of top professionals byÂ The InternationalÂ at the end ofÂ August.Weâll kick off the OpenAI Five Benchmark with some warmup games against audience members; please let us know on theÂ invite requestÂ form if youâd like toÂ volunteer.Game rulesBecause our training systemÂ RapidÂ is very general, we were able to teach OpenAI Five many complex skills since June simply by integrating new features and randomizations. Many people pointed out that wards and Roshan were particularly important to includeâand now weâve done so. Weâve also increased the hero pool to 18 heroes. Many commenters thought these improvements wouldÂ takeÂ anotherÂ year. Weâll see how well these new game mechanics work on AugustÂ 5th!The latest version of OpenAI Five taking Roshan.We will play with the following restrictions (the crossed out restrictions are those lifted since the original OpenAI Five blog post), which correspond to the last bits of the game we havenâtÂ integrated:Pool of 18 heroes (Axe,Â Crystal Maiden,Â Death Prophet,Â Earthshaker,Â Gyrocopter,Â Lich,Â Lion,Â Necrophos,Â Queen of Pain,Â Razor,Â Riki,Â Shadow Fiend,Â Slark,Â Sniper,Â Sven,Â Tidehunter,Â Viper, orÂ Witch Doctor)Â Mirror match ofÂ Necrophos,Â Sniper,Â Viper,Â Crystal Maiden, andÂ LichNoÂ Divine Rapier,Â BottleÂ ,Â Quelling Blade,Â Boots of Travel,Â Tome of Knowledge,Â InfusedÂ RaindropNoÂ summons/illusions5 invulnerable couriers, no exploiting them by scouting orÂ tankingNoÂ ScanNoÂ wardingNoÂ RoshanNoÂ invisibilityÂ (consumables and relevantÂ items)Weâve increased the reaction time of OpenAI Five from 80ms to 200ms. This reaction time is much closer to human level, though we havenât seen evidence of changes in gameplay as OpenAI Fiveâs strength comes more from teamwork and coordination thanÂ reflexes.Event scheduleThe final date for the match is August 5, and will run asÂ follows:12pm PT: doorsÂ open12:30pm PT: livestream begins with âfor funâ audienceÂ games1:15pm PT: main event begins: intro and best-of-three versus 99.95th percentile DotaÂ playersWant to attend in person?If youâd like to attend the match in person in San Francisco, pleaseÂ request an inviteÂ by Friday July 20 at 11:59p PT; invites will be sent by the end of Monday July 23.
