Weâre also releasing an open-source legal agreement to make it easier for organizations to initiate model-sharing partnerships with each other, and are publishing a technical report about our experience in coordinating with the wider AI research community on publicationÂ norms.August 20, 2019More resourcesRead paperView codeLegal agreementLanguage,Â Responsible AI,Â Community,Â Publication,Â ReleaseKey things weâve learned1. Coordination is difficult, but possible.Â To date, there hasnât been a public release of a 1558M parameter language model, though multiple organizations have developed the systems to train them, or have publicly discussed how to train larger models. For example, teams from both NLP developerÂ Hugging FaceÂ and theÂ Allen Institute for Artificial IntelligenceÂ (AI2) with the University of WashingtonÂ have explicitly adopted similar staged release approaches to us. Since February, weâve spoken with more than five groups who have replicated GPT-2.[^footnote-conversations]2. Humans can be convinced by synthetic text.Â Research from our research partners Sarah Kreps and Miles McCain at CornellÂ published inÂ Foreign AffairsÂ says people find GPT-2 synthetic text samples almost as convincing (72% in one cohort judged the articles to be credible) as real articles from the New York Times (83%).[^footnote-samples]Â Additionally, research from AI2/UW has shown that news written by a system called âGROVERâ can beÂ more plausible than human-written propaganda. These research results make us generally more cautious about releasing languageÂ models.3. Detection isnât simple.Â In practice, we expect detectors to need to detect a significant fraction of generations with very few false positives. Malicious actors may use a variety of sampling techniques (including rejection sampling) or fine-tune models to evade detection methods. A deployed system likely needs to be highly accurate (99.9%â99.99%) on a variety of generations. Our research suggests that current ML-based methods only achieve low to midâ90s accuracy, and that fine-tuning the language models decreases accuracy further. There are promising paths forward (see especially those advocated by the developers of âGROVERâ) but itâs a genuinely difficult research problem. We believe that statistical detection of text needs to be supplemented with human judgment and metadata related to the text in order to effectively combat misuse of languageÂ models.PartnershipsWeâve partnered with four leading research organizations to analyze both the newly-released 774M parameter GPT-2 model and the unreleased full-size GPT-2 model. Weâve included some preliminary results from them in our technical report, and their ongoing analysis will factor into the potential release of the 1558M model. Weâve also developed a non-commercial legal agreement to facilitate the sharing of models between organizations and are publishing it here to help others initiate such sharingÂ schemes.Cornell UniversityÂ is studying human susceptibility to digital disinformation generated by languageÂ models.The Middlebury Institute of International StudiesÂ Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism (CTEC) is exploring how GPT-2 could be misused by terrorists and extremistsÂ online.The University of OregonÂ is developing a series of âbias probesâ to analyze bias withinÂ GPT-2.The University of Texas at AustinÂ is studying the statistical detectability of GPT-2 outputs after fine-tuning the model on domain-specific datasets, as well as the extent of detection transfer across different languageÂ models.Future release decisionsResearch from these partners will factor into our future release decisions, as will observing how the 774M model is used, and discussing language models with researchers and policymakers to understand the considerations around larger models. As part of our staged release strategy, our current plan is to release the 1558M parameter model in a few months, but itâs plausible that findings from a partner, or malicious usage of our 774M model, could changeÂ this.We think that a combination of staged release and partnership-based model sharing is likely to be a key foundation of responsible publication in AI, particularly in the context of powerful generative models. The issues inherent to large models are going to grow, rather than diminish, over time. We hope that our work on GPT-2, discussed further in theÂ technical reportÂ weâre publishing, will help provide evidence the AI community can draw on when thinking about the publication challenges inherent to some parts of AIÂ research.Timeline2019FebruaryOpenAI publishes aÂ blog postÂ andÂ paperÂ on GPT-2.Released small parameter (124M) GPT-2Â model.2019MarchThe Partnership on AI co-hosts a dinner with OpenAI toÂ discuss publication norms, then publishes a blog summarizing theÂ discussion.2019MayReleased medium parameter (355M) model.Released dataset of outputs from large-scale models.Released a detection baseline to help people understand how to detect outputs of models like GPT-2.The original blog post isÂ updatedÂ to reflect these changes.Adam KingÂ launchesÂ âTalktoTransformer.comâ, giving people an interface to play with the newly released models.Hugging Face releases a conversational AI demo based on GPT-2 models, discusses some of the ethical considerations in the release decision, andÂ decides not to release the large GPT-2 model.Researchers with the University of Washington and Allen Institute for AI ResearchÂ reveal GROVER, a GPT-2âstyle language model; they do not release the large versions of the model, and conduct research into the detection of the outputs of suchÂ models.2019JuneOpenAI testifies in CongressÂ about the implications of synthetic media, including a discussion of synthetic text.DeepMind discusses GPT-2 and the importance of appropriate publication norms for generative models in their recentÂ discussionÂ of unsupervised learning.OpenAI commences a research collaboration with theÂ Partnership on AIÂ for publication norms in AI research.
