Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive humanÂ impact.We believe AI should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible. The outcome of this venture is uncertain and the work is difficult, but we believe the goal and the structure are right. We hope this is what matters most to the best in theÂ field.BackgroundArtificial intelligence has always been a surprising field. In the early days, people thought that solving certain tasks (such as chess) would lead us to discover human-level intelligence algorithms. However, the solution to each task turned out to be much less general than people were hoping (such as doing a search over a huge number ofÂ moves).The past few years have held another flavor of surprise. An AI technique explored for decades, deep learning, started achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of problem domains. In deep learning, rather than hand-code a new algorithm for each problem, you design architectures that can twist themselves into a wide range of algorithms based on the data you feedÂ them.This approach has yielded outstanding results on pattern recognition problems, such as recognizing objects in images, machine translation, and speech recognition. But weâve also started to see what it might be like for computers to beÂ creative, toÂ dream, and toÂ experience theÂ world.Looking forwardAI systems today have impressive but narrow capabilities. It seems that weâll keep whittling away at their constraints, and in the extreme case they will reach human performance on virtually every intellectual task. Itâs hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and itâs equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or usedÂ incorrectly.OpenAIBecause of AIâs surprising history, itâs hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach. When it does, itâll be important to have a leading research institution which can prioritize a good outcome for all over its ownÂ self-interest.Weâre hoping to grow OpenAI into such an institution. As a non-profit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any) will be shared with the world. Weâll freely collaborate with others across many institutions and expect to work with companies to research and deploy newÂ technologies.OpenAIâs research director isÂ Ilya Sutskever, one of the world experts in machine learning. Our CTO isÂ Greg Brockman, formerly the CTO of Stripe. The groupâs other founding members are world-class research engineers and scientists:Â Trevor Blackwell,Â Vicki Cheung,Â Andrej Karpathy,Â Durk Kingma,Â John Schulman,Â Pamela Vagata, andÂ Wojciech Zaremba. Pieter Abbeel, Yoshua Bengio, Alan Kay, Sergey Levine, and Vishal Sikka are advisors to the group. OpenAIâs co-chairs are Sam Altman and ElonÂ Musk.Sam, Greg, Elon, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, andÂ YC ResearchÂ are donating to support OpenAI. In total, these funders have committedÂ $1 billion, although we expect to only spend a tiny fraction of this in the next fewÂ years.You can follow us on Twitter atÂ @OpenAI.AuthorsGreg BrockmanView all articlesIlya SutskeverView all articlesOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
