You canÂ opt-in to share data.Any data sent through the API will be retained for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law).The OpenAI API processes user prompts and completions, as well as training data submitted to fine-tune models via the Files endpoint. We refer to this data as API data.By default, OpenAI will not use API data to train OpenAI models or improve OpenAIâs service offering. Data submitted by the user for fine-tuning will only be used to fine-tune the customer's model. However, OpenAI will allow users to opt-in to share their data toÂ improve model performance.Â Sharing your dataÂ will ensure that future iterations of the model improve for your use cases. Data submitted to the API prior to March 1, 2023 (the effective date of this change) may have been used for improvements if the customer had not previously opted out of sharing data.OpenAI retains API data for 30 days for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes. A limited number of authorized OpenAI employees, as well as specialized third-party contractors that are subject to confidentiality and security obligations, can access this data solely to investigate and verify suspected abuse. OpenAI may still have content classifiers flag when data is suspected to contain platform abuse. Data submitted by the user through the Files endpoint, for instance to fine-tune a model, is retained until the userÂ deletes the file.Note that this data policy does not apply to OpenAI's Non-API consumer services likeÂ ChatGPTÂ orÂ DALLÂ·E Labs. You can learn more about these policies in ourÂ data usage for consumer services FAQ.Frequently asked questionsWhat technical protections and security certifications does OpenAI have in place surrounding the public API?The OpenAI API isÂ SOC 2 Type 2 compliantÂ and has been audited by an independent third-party auditor against theÂ 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security.Where is API data stored?Content is stored on OpenAI systems and our sub-processorsâ systems. We may also send select portions of de-identified content to third-party contractors (subject to confidentiality and security obligations) safety purposes. Our 30-day data retention policy also applies to our sub-processors and contractors. You can view ourÂ list of sub-processors and their locationsÂ for details.When I call the API, is the data encrypted in transit?The OpenAI API is only available over Transport Layer Security (TLS), and therefore customer-to-OpenAI requests and responses are encrypted.Do you offer EU data residency?Not presently. We continue to explore the feasibility and impact of enabling localized data storage.Can I use the API for HIPAA workloads?We are able to sign Business Associate Agreements in support of customersâ compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To qualify for this, you must have an Enterprise Agreement with OpenAI and a qualifying use case. PleaseÂ reach out to our sales teamÂ if you are interested.Iâve received a data deletion request, how do I ask OpenAI to delete data?We only retain data sent through the API for up to 30 days for abuse and monitoring purposes. If you would like to delete your account before then, pleaseÂ follow these steps.Does OpenAI have a Data Processing Addendum (DPA)?Yes. Please complete ourÂ DPA formÂ to execute our Data Processing Addendum.Can we self-host?We do not offer on-premise hosting. You may purchase dedicated capacity byÂ reaching out to our sales team.ResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
