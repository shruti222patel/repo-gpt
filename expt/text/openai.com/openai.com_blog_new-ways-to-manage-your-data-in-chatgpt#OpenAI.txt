Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled wonât be used to train and improve our models, and wonât appear in the history sidebar. These controls, which are rolling out to all users starting today, can be found in ChatGPTâs settings and can be changed at any time. We hope this provides an easier way to manage your data than our existing opt-out process. When chat history is disabled, we will retain new conversations for 30 days and review them only when needed to monitor for abuse, before permanently deleting.New chatTodayAI CapabilitiesBrooklyn Sunrise TimeYesterdayManhattan Bus ComparisonsTypo Assistance RequestSLR Film CamerasLast 7 DaysQuadratic Function PlotiPod Touch PoemToyota Names PoetryClassic Lasagne RecipeCowboy Seinfeld EpisodeShift String with NumberAI CapabilitiesChat history is off.Chats wonât be saved in your history or used for training our models to improve ChatGPT.
