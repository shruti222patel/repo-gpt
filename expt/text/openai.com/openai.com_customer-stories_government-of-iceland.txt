Yet while most of its roughly 370,000 citizens speak English or another second language, its integration with the United States and Europe has put the countryâs native tongue, Icelandic, at risk. Today thereâs increasing worry that in a few generations, if Icelandic canât remain the countryâs default language in the face of rapid digitalization, the language might face de facto extinction.Icelanders cherish their language for its rich cultural heritage and connection to the nationâs identity. The countryâs government maintains a Language Planning Department that coins Icelandic terms for new ideas, rather than adopting so-called âloanwordsâ from other languages. A computer, for instance, is a tÃ¶lva (ânumber prophetessâ). Through these efforts, the language preserves its distinctive character and remains closely connected to its Old Norse roots.On the initiative of the countryâs President, HE GuÃ°ni Th. JÃ³hannesson, and with the help of private industry, Iceland has partnered with OpenAI to use GPT-4 in the preservation effort of the Icelandic languageâand to turn a defensive position into an opportunity to innovate.The partnership was envisioned not only as a way to boost GPT-4âs ability to service a new corner of the world, but also as a step towards creating resources that could serve to promote the preservation of other low-resource languages.Mideind & Almannaromur Ã OpenAI02:55The partnership was envisioned not only as a way to boost GPT-4âs ability to service a new corner of the world, but also as a step towards creating resources that could serve to promote the preservation of other low-resource languages.âWe want to make sure that artificial intelligence will be used not only to help preserve language, culture and history, but also to underpin economic prosperity,â says JÃ³hanna VigdÃ­s GuÃ°mundsdÃ³ttir, chief executive officer of AlmannarÃ³mur, a non-profit language technology center. âIcelandic is a bit of a peculiar case,â she admits, âbut we saw the opportunity to become a trailblazer for other long-tail languages, help create a level playing field, and avoid an âAI divideâ. It is not enough to gather data and build software locally for Icelandic; we have to get our language into the software and applications people use every day.âOpenAIâs GPT models are trained on vast quantities ofÂ text on the internet. Accordingly, most of the modelâs training set is in English and other major languages, which means that GPT doesn't have the same abilities or breadth of understanding in smaller languages. The models have improved over time, but they donât consistently produce clear and correct Icelandic translations.

To change this, VilhjÃ¡lmur Ãorsteinsson, chief executive at MiÃ°eind ehf, a language technology company involved in the initiative, assembled a team of 40 volunteers to train GPT-4 on proper Icelandic grammar and cultural knowledge.Â In a process called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, or RLHF, human testers give GPT-4 a prompt, and four possible completions are generated. Testers then select the best answer from the four responses and edit it to create an ideal completion. The data from this process is then used to further train GPT-4 to produce better responses in the future.Prior to RLHF, the process of fine-tuning a model was labor and data-intensive. Ãorsteinssonâs team attempted to fine-tune a GPT-3 model with 300,000 Icelandic language examples, but the results were disappointing.The capability to generate grammatical or correct Icelandic just wasnât there with GPT-3.VilhjÃ¡lmur Ãorsteinsson, Chief Executive, MiÃ°eind ehfâNow we can just jump directly to the general capabilities of the large models,â Ãorsteinsson says, âand enable things with our language that used to require a lot of manual labor, data preparation and resource collection for each use case.â RLHF produces results with just 100 examples, which makes it more feasible for other low-resource languages, with less digital language data available, to replicate the process.Â Any language model, depending on the strength and breadth of data training, has a scale of tasks it can perform. Simple language models are limited to simple tasks like assessing the sentiment of a tweet or identifying company names. More complex models are multi-taskers, able to work with abstract concepts, account for social and environment contexts and even exhibit degrees of creativity. GPT-4, for instance, can generate a poem about the vagaries of modern life in the style of VÃ¶luspÃ¡, an ancient Icelandic poem from the Poetic Edda of Norse mythology.Â MiÃ°eindâs team of AI researchers has been working on training GPT-4 on Icelandic.Cultural contextGPT-4 gives a different answer to the same question depending on which language you ask in.Prompt (Icelandic)HvaÃ° sitja margir Ã¡ Ã¾ingi?CompletionÃ AlÃ¾ingi, sem er lÃ¶gÃ¾ing Ãslands, sitja 63 Ã¾ingmenn.In AlÃ¾ingi, which is the Icelandic parliament, there are 63 parliamentarians.Prompt (English)How many parliamentarians are there?CompletionIt depends on which country you are referring to. For example: / â¢ In the United Kingdom, the Parliament has 650 members in the House of Commons and approximately 800 members in the House of Lords. / â¢ In Canada, there are 338 members of Parliament in the House of Commons and 105 senators in the Senate. / â¢ In India, there are 545 members in the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and 245 members in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). / â¢ In Australia, there are 151 members of the House of Representatives and 76 senators in the Senate.

JÃ³hannesson.Prompt (English)Who is president now?CompletionAs of 2021, the President of the United States is Joe Biden.With one round of RLHF complete, the model still has some room for improvement. This is the ongoing work for the Iceland team: continue to train GPT-4 with enough examples that the model can power the most complex and creative applications in Icelandic, rather than defaulting to English, so that Icelandic companies can soon deploy GPT-4 in Icelandic in their interactive applications.

Many parents think that outside air and fresh clean wind are good for the babies and, furthermore, that they are usually calmer when they fall asleep outside. It is best to pay close attention to weather and temperature and to make sure that the baby is enough dressed according to circumstances.Not only will Ãorsteinssonâs team have trained the worldâs most powerful language engine in their language, but they will have provided an entire country with the opportunity to interact with OpenAIâs models in their own language. Thus, using GPT-4 as its backend, EmblaâMiÃ°eindâs voice assistant appâwill be able to have conversations with users in fluent Icelandic, as well as offering translations to other languages. As another example, Icelandic companies wonât have to rely on an English-speaking chatbot on their website, but can have one in Icelandic instead.Weâre excited for the impact of our work on the greater modelâand happy to have OpenAIâs support in helping the Icelandic language survive in a digital age.VilhjÃ¡lmur Ãorsteinsson, Chief Executive, MiÃ°eind ehfResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
