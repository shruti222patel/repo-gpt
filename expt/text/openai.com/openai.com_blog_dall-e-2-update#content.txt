Weâre excited to begin adding up to 1,000 new users from our waitlist each week.Â Illustration: Justin Jay Wang Ã DALLÂ·EMay 18, 2022AuthorsJoanne JangOpenAI AnnouncementsLast month, we started previewing DALLÂ·E 2 to a limited number of trusted users to learn about the technologyâs capabilities andÂ limitations.Since then, weâve been working with our users to actively incorporate the lessons we learn. As ofÂ today:Our users have collectively created over 3 million images withÂ DALLÂ·E.Weâve enhanced our safety system, improving the text filters and tuning the automated detection & response system for content policyÂ violations.Less than 0.05% of downloaded or publicly shared images were flagged as potentially violating our content policy. About 30% of those flagged images were confirmed by human reviewers to be policy violations, leading to an accountÂ deactivation.As we work to understand and address the biases that DALLÂ·E has inherited from its training data, weâve asked early users not to share photorealistic generations that include faces and to flag problematic generations. We believe this has been effective in limiting potential harm, and we plan to continue the practice in the currentÂ phase.Learning from real-world use is anÂ important partÂ of our commitment to develop and deploy AI responsibly, so weâre starting to widen access to users who joined our waitlist, slowly butÂ steadily.We intend to onboard up to 1,000 people every week as we iterate on our safety system and require all users to abide by ourÂ content policy. We hope to increase the rate at which we onboard new users as we learn more and gain confidence in our safety system. Weâre inspired by what our users have created with DALLÂ·E so far, and excited to see what new users willÂ create.In the meantime, you can get a preview of these creations on our Instagram account:Â @openaidalle.AuthorsJoanne JangView all articlesOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
