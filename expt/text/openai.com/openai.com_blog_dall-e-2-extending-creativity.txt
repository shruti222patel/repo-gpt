The artists in our early access group have helped us discover new uses for DALLÂ·E and have served as key voices as weâve made decisions about DALLÂ·EâsÂ features.Illustration: Justin Jay Wang Ã DALLÂ·EJuly 14, 2022AuthorsOpenAI CommunityCreative professionals using DALLÂ·E today range from illustrators, AR designers, and authors to chefs, landscape architects, tattoo artists, and clothing designers, to directors, sound designers, dancers, and much more. The list expands everyÂ day.Below are just a few examples of how artists are making use of this newÂ technology.The OrrigosJames and his wife Kristin Orrigo created theÂ Big Dreams Virtual TourÂ which focuses on creating special memories and a positive distraction for pediatric cancer patients around the world. The Orrigos have worked in top childrenâs hospitals around the country and now virtually meet up with families, bringing childrenâs ideas to life through personalized cartoons, music videos, and mobility friendly video games. Orrigo says children and teens light up when they see their DALLÂ·E-generated creations, and they are ready to be the star of a story brought to life from theirÂ imaginations.Most recently, Orrigo and his team have been working with a young cancer survivor named Gianna to create a music video featuring herself as Wonder Woman fighting her enemy: the cancerÂ cells."We didnât know what an osteosarcoma villain would look like so we turned to DALLÂ·E as our creative outlet. DALLÂ·E gave us a huge amount of inspiration,â Orrigo said. âUnfortunately, Gianna knows this battle all too well. But we are celebrating her victory by bringing her cartoon music video to real life to spread awareness about pediatric cancer and to give Gianna an unforgettableÂ memory.â   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by James Orrigo (@ladinabattle)   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by James Orrigo (@ladinabattle)   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by James Orrigo (@ladinabattle)Stefan KutzenbergerIn a project conceived by Austrian artist Stefan Kutzenberger and Clara Blume, Head of the Open Austria Art + Tech Lab in San Francisco, DALLÂ·E was used to bring the poetry of revolutionary painterÂ Egon SchieleÂ into the visual world. Schiele died at 28, but Kutzenbergerâa curator at the Leopold Museum in Vienna, which houses the worldâs largest collection of Schieleâs worksâbelieves that DALLÂ·E gives the world a glimpse of what Schieleâs later work might have been like if he had had a chance to keep painting. The DALLÂ·E works will be exhibited alongside Schieleâs collection in the Leopold Museum in the comingÂ months. "A painting of tall trees walking along a road, with chirping and trembling birds in front of a white sky in them in the style of Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele"  "Lakeshore Without Sun, 1913 in the expressionist style of Egon Schiele" Karen X ChengKaren X Cheng, a director known for sharing her creative experiments on Instagram, created the latestÂ cover of Cosmopolitan MagazineÂ using DALLÂ·E. In her post unveiling the process, Karen compared working with DALLÂ·E to a musician playing anÂ instrument."Like any musical instrument, you get better with practiceâ¦and knowing what words to use to communicate? Thatâs a community effortâitâs come from the past few months of me talking to other DALLÂ·E artists on Twitter, Discord, DM. I learned from other artists that you could ask for specific camera angles. Lens types. Lighting conditions. Weâre all figuring it out together, how to play this beautiful newÂ instrument.â   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by Karen X (@karenxcheng)   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by Karen X (@karenxcheng)   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by Karen X (@karenxcheng)Tom AvivIsraeli chef and MasterChef winnerÂ Tom AvivÂ is debuting hisÂ first U.S. restaurant in MiamiÂ in a few months and has used DALLÂ·E for menu, decor, and ambiance inspirationâand his team have also used DALLÂ·E to in designing the way they plateÂ dishes.It was Tomâs sister and business partner Kimâs idea to run a family recipe for chocolate mousse throughÂ DALLÂ·E."Itâs called Picasso chocolate mousse, and itâs a tribute to my parents,â she explained. âDALLÂ·E elevates it to another levelâit is just phenomenal. It changed the dish from your usual chocolate mousse to something that does service to the name and to our parents. It blew ourÂ minds.âBranja is expected to open inÂ October.

He hosts a weekly Instagram Live teaching people about DALLÂ·E and other tools for creativeÂ innovation."Digital tools freed me up to have a life that I am proud of and love,â Stevenson says. âI want to help other people to see creative technology like DALLÂ·E the way that I see itâso they can become free asÂ well.â   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by Don Allen Stevenson III (@donalleniii)   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by Don Allen Stevenson III (@donalleniii)Danielle BaskinDanielle Baskin, a multimedia artist, says she plans to incorporate DALLÂ·E generations across a number of different art forms: product design, illustration, theater, and alternativeÂ realities."Itâs a mood board, vibe generator, illustrator, art curator, and museum docent,â Baskin says. âItâs an infinite museum where I can choose which private collections I want to visit. Sometimes I need to repair the private collections (tweak my prompt writing). Sometimes the collection isnât quite there. But sometimes the docent (DALLÂ·E 2) shows me a surprising new collection I didnât knowÂ existed.â   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by Danielle Baskin ð¿ (@daniellecomputer)San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge is one of my most favorite train routes in the world.

I feel empowered by the ability to creatively iterate on a feeling or idea, and I deeply believe that all people deserve that sense ofÂ empowerment.

His characters range from âa red furry monster looks in wonder at a burning candleâ to âa striped hairy monster shakes its hips dancing underneath a disco ball,â each crafted to capture the most human thing of all: feelings."DALLÂ·E is the most advanced paint brush Iâve ever used,â Nelson says. âAs mind-blowing and amazing as DALLÂ·E is, like the paint brush, it too must be guided by the artist. It still needs that creative spark, that lightbulb in the mind to innovateâto create that something fromÂ nothing.â   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by C Nelson (@dailydall.e)   View this post on Instagram        A post shared by C Nelson (@dailydall.e)AuthorsOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
