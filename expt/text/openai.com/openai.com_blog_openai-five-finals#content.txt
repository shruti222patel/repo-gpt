We believe that AIâs impact on the world will be driven by its competence, scalability, and ability to enhance what humans can doâand this event will use OpenAI Five to concretely demonstrate each of these. We hope Finals will help people better internalize AI progress and how it will affect the world.We started working with Dota 2 because we expected it to be a good testbed for developingÂ general-purpose AI technologies. It has additionally turned out to be a great avenue for helping people experience modern AIâwhich we expect to become a high-stakes part of peopleâs lives in the future, starting with systems like self-drivingÂ cars.As part of the event, weâre honored to compete against the reigning Dota 2 world champions,Â OG, who will test OpenAI Five at the limits of human ability. Weâll also be joined byÂ Blitz,Â Capitalist,Â ODPixel,Â Purge, andÂ Sheever. Games will be played with rules similar to those used for the OpenAI Five matches atÂ The InternationalÂ 2018.Watch the eventOpenAI Five Finals will be hosted in the Bay Area on April 13.
