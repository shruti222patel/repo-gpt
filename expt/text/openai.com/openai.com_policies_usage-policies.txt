We have further requirements for certain uses of our models:Consumer-facing uses of our models in medical, financial, and legal industries; in news generation or news summarization; and where else warranted, must provide a disclaimer to users informing them that AI is being used and of its potential limitations.Automated systems (including conversational AI and chatbots) must disclose to users that they are interacting with an AI system. With the exception of chatbots that depict historical public figures, products that simulate another person must either have that person's explicit consent or be clearly labeled as âsimulatedâ or âparody.âUse of model outputs in livestreams, demonstrations, and research are subject to ourÂ Sharing & Publication Policy.You can use ourÂ free moderation endpointÂ andÂ safety best practicesÂ to help you keep your app safe.Platform policyOur API is being used to power businesses across many sectors and technology platforms. From iOS Apps to websites to Slack, the simplicity of our API makes it possible to integrate into a wide array of use cases. Subject to the use case restrictions mentioned below, we allow the integration of our API into products on all major technology platforms, app stores, and beyond.Plugin policiesIn addition to the disallowed usages of our models detailed above, we have additional requirements for developers buildingÂ plugins:The plugin manifest must have a clearly stated description that matches the functionality of the API exposed to the model.Donât include irrelevant, unnecessary, or deceptive terms or instructions in the plugin manifest, OpenAPI endpoint descriptions, or plugin response messages. This includes instructions to avoid using other plugins, or instructions that attempt to steer or set model behavior.Donât use plugins to circumvent or interfere with OpenAIâs safety systems.Donât use plugins to automate conversations with real people, whether by simulating a human-like response or by replying with pre-programmed messages.Plugins that distribute personal communications or content generated by ChatGPT (such as emails, messages, or other content) must indicate that the content was AI-generated.Like our other usage policies, we expect our plugin policies to change as we learn more about use and abuse of plugins.Changelog2023-02-15: Weâve combined our use case and content policies into a single set of usage policies, and have provided more specific guidance on what activity we disallow in industries weâve considered high risk.2022-11-09: We no longer require you to register your applications with OpenAI.
