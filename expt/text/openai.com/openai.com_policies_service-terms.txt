Plugins(a)Â  Overview. Plugins are a feature in ChatGPT that allow you to send instructions to and receive information from another application or website (âApplicationâ) while using our Services. Each Plugin is made available by the developer of the Application, which is typically a third party not affiliated with OpenAI. You may take action on an Application through one or more Plugins. For example, you may enable a plugin for a restaurant reservation website to request a reservation via the Services. You are solely responsible for the actions you take using Plugins. You must manually enable each plugin, which allows the applicable Service to access and use the enabled plugin. OpenAI may (but will have no obligation) to review, refuse, or remove Applications from ChatGPT. However, by using Plugins, you may be exposed to Applications or content that you may find offensive, inappropriate or objectionable. You agree that you use Plugins at your own risk. DO NOT ENABLE A PLUGIN UNLESS YOU KNOW AND TRUST THE UNDERLYING APPLICATION AND HAVE REVIEWED ITS TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY.(b) Plugin Operation and Content. When you enable a plugin, the Services will send applicable portions of your Content and certain information such as your country and state (âPlugin Dataâ) via the plugin to the Application. By enabling the plugin, you authorize and instruct us to send your Plugin Data to the applicable Application, which will be handled in accordance with its terms. We are not responsible for Plugin Data after it has been provided to an Application other than Applications owned by us. The Plugin will retrieve information and content from the Application, which may be included in Output you receive from the Services. This information and content included in the Output is not owned by you or OpenAI, and may be subject to the terms of the Application.
