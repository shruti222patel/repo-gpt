Additionally, Elon Musk will depart the OpenAI Board but will continue to donate and advise the organization. As Tesla continues to become more focused on AI, this will eliminate a potential future conflict forÂ Elon.Weâre broadening our base of funders to prepare for the next phase of OpenAI, which will involve ramping up our investments in our people and the compute resources necessary to make consequential breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. OpenAI was founded a little over two years ago and since that time weâve paired ourÂ research effortsÂ with applied work to push the limits of what AI systems are capable of via our work inÂ roboticsÂ andÂ Dota. Thatâs going to continue, and in the coming months you can also expect us to articulate the principles with which weâll be approaching the next phase of OpenAI, and the policy areas in which we wish to see changes to ensure AI benefits all ofÂ humanity.The Board is now Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Holden Karnofsky, and Sam Altman. We will add another director soon, and plan over time to further expand the Board. If youâre interested in working with us on this mission, considerÂ joiningÂ OpenAI.ResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
