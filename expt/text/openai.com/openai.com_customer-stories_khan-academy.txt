The organization offers thousands of lessons in math, science and the humanities for students of all ages.Â But every student is unique, and their grasp of concepts and skills variesâby a lot. Some may breeze through a subject while others need step-by-step help. And when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted countless education systems, that disparity for a lot of classrooms only deepened.Â âItâs challenging to keep everyone advancing, given their different needs,â says Khan Academyâs Chief Learning Officer Kristen DiCerbo. âTheyâre all at different levels. They all have different gaps. They all need different things to move forward. That is a problem weâve been trying to solve for a long time.âToday Khan Academy is announcing that it will use GPT-4 to power Khanmigo, an AI-powered assistant that functions as both a virtual tutor for students and a classroom assistant for teachers. The nonprofit began testing the newest version of OpenAIâs language model in 2022 and will initially make the Khanmigo pilot program available to a limited number of participants, though the public is invited to join the waitlist.Khan Academy 5th Grade Math Q&A00:22We think GPT-4 is opening up new frontiers in education. A lot of people have dreamed about this kind of technology for a long time. Itâs transformative and we plan to proceed responsibly with testing to explore if it can be used effectively for learning and teaching.Kristen DiCerbo, Chief Learning Officer, Khan AcademyâWe think GPT-4 is opening up new frontiers in education,â says DiCerbo. âA lot of people have dreamed about this kind of technology for a long time. Itâs transformative and we plan to proceed responsibly with testing to explore if it can be used effectively for learning and teaching.âKhan Academy is running Khanmigo as a pilot to explore AI responsibly. Early participants will be watching for errors, especially in math questions, and flagging them for correction.One of GPT-4âs chief capabilities is being able to understand freeform questions and prompts. That abilityâto have a human-like back and forthâprovides Khan Academy with perhaps the most key capability: asking each student individualized questions to prompt deeper learning.Khanmigo Math Problem00:16âOne of the things we and all educational technology companies struggle with is how to get students thinking deeply about the content that theyâre learning,â DiCerbo says. âTo think about questions like, âWhy did you answer that way? Why do you think that's true? What would happen ifâ?â So weâre making sure students aren't just understanding how to do the problem, but really understanding the concepts behind them.âEarly testing by Khan Academy indicates that GPT-4 may soon be able to help students contextualize the greater relevance of what theyâre studying or teach specific points of computer programming.âThese were all things we were thinking about deeply and then GPT-4 showed up,â says director of engineering, Shawn Jansepar. âWe see this technology as a potential way to accelerate our roadmap of building more tutor-like abilities into our platform within the next few years, while also providing capabilities we had only dreamed of before. Without a really powerful large-language model, these ideas werenât feasible, but now we think we can make real progress.âAdapting GPT-4 for teachers is also top of mind for Khan Academy. The nonprofit is testing out ways teachers could use GPT-4, such as writing classroom prompts or creating instructional materials for lessons.Â âWhatâs even more exciting is the potential to help teachers tailor learning for every student quickly and easily,â said director of program and product management, Ricky Chandarana. âWe think teachers could use GPT-4 to get a snapshot of how every student in their class is doing on Khan Academy on any given day. Weâre going to test out that feature in the very near future.â Khanmigo for teachers00:30âHow often do students say, âWhy should I learn this? Why should I even care?ââ DiCerbo says. âAnd just in our early testing in putting GPT-4 in front of them, they're asking those questions. And GPT-4 is answering specifically for them, so a student can say, âHey I'm interested in X-kinds of thingsâ and GPT-4 can provide them with that specific motivation.âResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
