Weâll need to invest billions of dollars in upcoming years into large-scale cloud compute, attracting and retaining talented people, and building AIÂ supercomputers.We want to increase our ability to raise capital while still serving our mission, and no pre-existing legal structure we know of strikes the right balance. Our solution is to create OpenAI LP as a hybrid of a for-profit and nonprofitâwhich we are calling a âcapped-profitâÂ company.The fundamental idea of OpenAI LP is that investors and employees can get a capped return if we succeed at our mission, which allows us to raise investment capital and attract employees with startup-like equity. But any returns beyond that amountâand if we are successful, we expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than weâd owe to people who invest in or work at OpenAI LPâare owned by the original OpenAI NonprofitÂ entity.Going forward (in this post and elsewhere), âOpenAIâ refers to OpenAI LP (which now employs most of our staff), and the original entity is referred to as âOpenAIÂ Nonprofit.âThe mission comes firstWeâve designed OpenAI LP to put our overall missionâensuring the creation and adoption of safe and beneficial AGIâahead of generating returns forÂ investors.The mission comes first even with respect to OpenAI LPâs structure. While we are hopeful that what we describe below will work until our mission is complete, we may update our implementation as the world changes. Regardless of how the world evolves, we are committedâlegally and personallyâto ourÂ mission.OpenAI LPâs primary fiduciary obligation is to advance the aims of theÂ OpenAI Charter, and the company is controlled by OpenAI Nonprofitâs board. All investors and employees sign agreements that OpenAI LPâs obligation to the Charter always comes first, even at the expense of some or all of their financialÂ stake.Our employee and investor paperwork start with big purple boxes like this. The general partner refers to OpenAI Nonprofit (whose legal name is âOpenAI Incâ); limited partners refers to investors and employees.Only a minority of board members are allowed to hold financial stakes in the partnership at one time. Furthermore, only board members without such stakes can vote on decisions where the interests of limited partners and OpenAI Nonprofitâs mission may conflictâincluding any decisions about making payouts to investors andÂ employees.Another provision from our paperwork specifies that OpenAI Nonprofit retains control.As mentioned above, economic returns for investors and employees are capped (with the cap negotiated in advance on a per-limited partner basis). Any excess returns go to OpenAI Nonprofit. Our goal is to ensure that most of the value (monetary or otherwise) we create if successful benefits everyone, so we think this is an important first step. Returns for our first round of investors are capped at 100x their investment (commensurate with the risks in front of us), and we expect this multiple to be lower for future rounds as we make furtherÂ progress.What OpenAI doesOur day-to-day work is not changing. Today, we believe we can build the most value by focusing exclusively on developing new AI technologies, not commercial products. Our structure gives us flexibility for how to create a return in the long term, but we hope to figure that out only once weâve created safeÂ AGI.OpenAI LP currently employs around 100 people organized into three main areas: capabilities (advancing what AI systems can do), safety (ensuring those systems are aligned with human values), and policy (ensuring appropriate governance for such systems). OpenAI Nonprofit governs OpenAI LP, runs educational programs such asÂ ScholarsÂ andÂ Fellows, and hosts policy initiatives. OpenAI LP is continuing (at increased pace and scale) the development roadmap started at OpenAI Nonprofit, which has yielded breakthroughs inÂ reinforcement learning,Â robotics, andÂ language.SafetyWe are excited by the potential for AGI to help solve planetary-scale problems in areas where humanity is failing and there is no obvious solution today. However, we are also concerned about AGIâs potential to cause rapid change, whether through machines pursuing goals misspecified by their operator, malicious humans subverting deployed systems, or an out-of-control economy that grows without resulting in improvements to human lives. As described in ourÂ Charter, we are willing to merge with a value-aligned organization (even if it means reduced or zero payouts to investors) to avoid a competitive race which would make it hard to prioritizeÂ safety.Whoâs involvedOpenAI Nonprofitâs board consists of OpenAI LP employees Greg Brockman (Chairman & CTO), Ilya Sutskever (Chief Scientist), and Sam Altman (CEO), and non-employees Adam DâAngelo, Holden Karnofsky, Reid Hoffman, Shivon Zilis, and TashaÂ McCauley.[^board]Elon Musk left theÂ board of OpenAI NonprofitÂ in February 2018 and is not formally involved with OpenAI LP. We are thankful for all his pastÂ help.Our investors include Reid Hoffmanâs charitable foundation and Khosla Ventures, among others. We feel lucky to have mission-aligned, impact-focused, helpfulÂ investors!We are traveling a hard and uncertain path, but we have designed our structure to help us positively affect the world should we succeed in creating AGIâwhich we think will have as broad impact as the computer itself and improve healthcare, education, scientific research, and many aspects of peopleâs lives. If youâd like to help us make this mission a reality, weâreÂ hiringÂ :)!AuthorsGreg BrockmanView all articlesIlya SutskeverView all articlesOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
