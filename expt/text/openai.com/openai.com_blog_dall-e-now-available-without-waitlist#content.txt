Lessons learned from deployment and improvements to our safety systems make wider availability possible.Illustration: Justin Jay Wang Ã DALLÂ·ESeptember 28, 2022AuthorsOpenAI Product,Â AnnouncementsStarting today, we are removing the waitlist for the DALLÂ·E beta so users canÂ sign upÂ and start using it immediately. More than 1.5M users are now actively creating over 2M images a day with DALLÂ·E, fromÂ artists and creative directorsÂ to authors and architects, with over 100K users sharing their creations and feedback in our DiscordÂ community.Responsibly scaling a system as powerful and complex as DALLÂ·Eâwhile learning about all the creative ways it can be used and misusedâhas required an iterative deploymentÂ approach.Since we first previewed the DALLÂ·E research to users in April, users have helped us discover new uses for DALLÂ·E as a powerful creative tool. Artists, in particular, have provided important input on DALLÂ·EâsÂ features.âCyberpunk cat, 90s Japan anime styleâ by OpenAIâWildflowers, grassy field, autumn rhythm, watercolorâ by OpenAIâRunning at the edge of space, toward a planet, calm, reaching the abyss, digital artâ by OpenAIFollow @openaidalleTheir feedback inspired us to build features likeÂ Outpainting, which lets users continue an image beyond its original borders and create bigger images of any size, and collectionsâso users can create in all new ways and expedite their creativeÂ processes.Learning from real-world use has allowed us to improve our safety systems, making wider availability possible today. In the past months, weâve made our filters more robust at rejecting attempts to generate sexual, violent and other content that violates ourÂ content policyÂ and built new detection and response techniques to stopÂ misuse.We are currently testing a DALLÂ·E API with several customers and are excited to soon offer it more broadly to developers and businesses so they can build apps on this powerfulÂ system.We canât wait to see what users from around the world create with DALLÂ·E.Â Sign upÂ today and startÂ creating.Sign upOur journey over the past few months includes:2022SeptemberDALLÂ·E beta is available without a waitlist, over 1.5M users creating more than 2M images perÂ day2022AugustOutpaintingÂ is added to the EditÂ tool2022JulyDALLÂ·E available inÂ betaÂ with pricing, which enabled onboarding over 1 millionÂ users2022May1,000 users per weekÂ onboarded to researchÂ preview2022AprilDALLÂ·E 2 paperÂ published and Research Preview available to 200 artists, researchers, and trustedÂ users2021DecemberFirst version ofÂ GLIDE paperÂ isÂ published2021MayDiffusion modelsÂ outperform GANs on ImageNetÂ synthesis2021JanuaryOpenAI announces theÂ first DALLÂ·EÂ andÂ open-sourcesÂ CLIPAuthorsOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
