Welcome, everyone!Illustration: Justin Jay Wang Ã DALLÂ·EMarch 31, 2016AuthorsGreg BrockmanAnnouncementsFull-timersYura Burda.Â YuraÂ finished a math PhD at the age of 24, and switched into machine learning a year and a half ago. Heâs focusing onÂ generative models. HeÂ discoveredÂ a simple but fundamental improvement to the variational lower bound that had evaded notice since its original discovery decadesÂ ago.Ian Goodfellow.Â IanÂ is well known for his many contributions to machine learning, including theÂ MaxOut NetworkÂ and theÂ Generative Adversarial Network, the latter of which is a driver of excitement in generative modeling research. In addition, heâs the lead author of theÂ bookÂ on deepÂ learning.Alec Radford.Â AlecÂ createdÂ DCGAN, a neural model that could generate large, coherent images containing an unprecedented level of global coherence and detail. In addition, his model has learned to doÂ image analogiesÂ in an entirely unsupervisedÂ way.Tim Salimans.Â TimÂ is an expert on variational methods. The author of the firstÂ paperÂ on stochastic gradient variational inference (for which he won theÂ Lindley prize), he was at one point rankedÂ number 2 overallÂ onÂ Kaggle.InternsAlso joining us for the summer (and in some cases, to continue the collaboration once they return to their homeÂ institution):Peter Chen.Â PeterÂ previously co-founded aÂ startupÂ and did research on parallel computing and cognitive science. Recently, heâs been working on reinforcement learning, from theory to applications with deep neuralÂ nets.Rocky Duan.Â RockyÂ is a PhD student who previously co-founded aÂ startupÂ (with Peter) and worked on a number of projects in robotics. Heâs now transitioned to the field of deep reinforcement learning, and recently TAâd BerkeleyâsÂ Deep Reinforcement LearningÂ class.Linxi Fan.Â AlthoughÂ LinxiÂ is just finishing up his undergrad, he has already worked on aÂ varietyÂ of projects in deep learning, includingÂ Deep SpeechÂ 2.Jon Gauthier.Â JonÂ is an undergraduate student whose achievements include, among others, aÂ methodÂ that makes it possible to efficiently train large recursive neural networks on largeÂ datasets.Jonathan Ho.Â JonathanÂ is a PhD student at Stanford, where he is developing a new approach to imitation learning. Earlier in his research career, he had successÂ teaching robots how to tieÂ knots.Rein Houthooft.Â ReinÂ hails from Belgium, started his research career in the field of computer networking, and now is developing novel ways to incorporate uncertainty into deep reinforcement learningÂ algorithms.Eric Price.Â EricÂ is a professor of theoretical computer science at UT Austin. His achievements include the development and the analysis of aÂ faster-than-n log nÂ sparse Fourier transform. In his past life, he achieved aÂ perfect scoreÂ at theÂ IOI.As a closing note, we get a lot of questions about what weâre working on, how we work, and what weâre trying to achieve. Weâre not being intentionally mysterious; weâve just been busy launching the organization (and finding awesome people to help us doÂ so!).Weâre currently focused on unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. We should have interesting results to share over the next month or two. A bunch of us will be aroundÂ ICLR, where weâll likely hold an event of some form. Iâll also host aÂ Quora SessionÂ in May or June to answer any questions for people we donât meet in PuertoÂ Rico.AuthorsGreg BrockmanView all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
