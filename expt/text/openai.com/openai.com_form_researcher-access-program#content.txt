If you are interested in an opportunity for subsidized access, please provide details about your research use case. We are currently prioritizing research in the areas listed below, but are excited to hear about other research questions.We encourage applications from early stage researchers in countries supported by our API, and are especially interested in subsidizing work from researchers with limited financial and institutional resources.Before applying, please take a moment to review ourÂ Research Policy.ApplyFirst nameâ*Last nameâ*Emailâ*Institution or organizationâ*Which models available for researchers, if any, are you applying for access to?GPT-4 Base Model AccessCodex AccessWe currently have two models that are only available to a limited subset of researchers. The Codex models are currently being made available to a limited subset of researchers who were relying on these models for research purposes. The GPT-4 base model is currently being made available to a limited subset of researchers who are studying alignment or the risks and impact of AI systems.Country or regionâ*Select a countryâ¦AfghanistanAlbaniaAlgeriaAndorraAngolaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBhutanBoliviaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCabo VerdeCambodiaCameroonCanadaCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaColombiaComorosCongo (Congo-Brazzaville)Costa RicaCÃ´te dâIvoireCroatiaCubaCyprusCzechia (Czech Republic)Democratic Republic of the CongoDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini (formerly Swaziland)EthiopiaFijiFinlandFranceGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGreeceGrenadaGuatemalaGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHoly See (Vatican City)HondurasHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMauritaniaMauritiusMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNorth KoreaNorth MacedoniaNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinePanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPolandPortugalQatarRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-Leste (East Timor)TogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States of AmericaUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamYemenZambiaZimbabweSupported countries and territoriesResearch area(s)â*AlignmentHow can we understand what objective, if any, a model is best understood as pursuing? How do we increase the extent to which that objective is aligned with human preferences, such as via prompt design or fine-tuning?Fairness & representationHow should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation in language models? How can language models be improved in order to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed contexts?Interdisciplinary researchHow can AI development draw on insights from other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, and sociolinguistics?Interpretability/transparencyHow do these models work, mechanistically? Can we identify what concepts theyâre using, extract latent knowledge from the model, make inferences about the training procedure, or predict surprising future behavior?Misuse potentialHow can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of âred teamingâ approaches can we develop to help AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies like this?Model explorationModels like those served by the API have a variety of capabilities which weâve yet to explore. Weâre excited by investigations in many areas including model limitations, linguistic properties, commonsense reasoning, and potential uses for many other problems.RobustnessGenerative models have uneven capability surfaces, with the potential for surprisingly strong or weak areas of capability. How robust are large generative models to ânaturalâ perturbations in the prompt, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large generative models are more likely to be robust or not, and how does this relate to the training data? Are there techniques we can use to predict and mitigate worst-case behavior? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g., across variations in prompts)? Can we train models so that they satisfy safety properties with a very high level of reliability, even under adversarial inputs?OtherWeâre initially scoping to these areas, but welcome suggestions for future focus areas. The questions under each area are illustrative and weâd be delighted for research proposals that address different questions.Project descriptionâ*Within the research area selected above, please describe the type of work you plan on doing with the API and your approach.
