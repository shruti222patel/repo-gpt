Weâre also working to solidify our organizationâs governance structure and will share our thoughts on that later this year.Our metricDefining a metric for intelligence is tricky, but we need one to measure our progress and focus our research. Weâre thus building a living metric which measures how well an agent can achieve its userâs intended goal in a wide range ofÂ environments.Goal 1: Measure our progressThe metric will consist of a variety ofÂ OpenAI GymÂ environments with a unified action and observationÂ spaceÂ (so a single agent can run across all of them), including games, robotics, and language-based tasks. Our implementation will evolve over time, and weâll keep the community updated along theÂ way.Our researchA significant fraction of our research bandwidth is being spent on fundamental research. Weâll always be developing and testing new ideas, especially those that donât fit neatly into our current worldview. This is importantâour current ideas will not be enough to achieve our long-termÂ goal.Weâve also formed teams around specific projects. The intention isnât just to solve these problems, but to develop general learning algorithms in the process. These algorithms will, in turn, help us build agents that are more capable according to our metric. These projectsÂ are:Goal 2: Build a household robotWeâre working to enable a physical robot (off-the-shelf; not manufactured by OpenAI) to perform basic housework. There areÂ existingÂ techniquesÂ for specific tasks, but we believe that learning algorithms can eventually be madeÂ reliableÂ enoughÂ to create a general-purpose robot. More generally, robotics is a good testbed for many challenges inÂ AI.Goal 3: Build an agent with useful natural language understandingWe plan to build an agent that can perform a complex task specified by language, and ask for clarification about the task if itâs ambiguous. Today, there are promising algorithms for supervised language tasks such asÂ questionÂ answering,Â syntacticÂ parsingÂ andÂ machineÂ translationÂ but there arenât any for more advanced linguistic goals, such as the ability to carry a conversation, the ability to fully understand a document, and the ability to follow complex instructions in natural language. We expect to develop new learning algorithms and paradigms to tackle theseÂ problems.Goal 4: Solve a wide variety of games using a single agentWe aim to train an agent capable enough to solve any game in our initial metric. Games are virtual mini-worlds that are very diverse, and learning to play games quickly and well will require significant advances inÂ generative modelsÂ andÂ reinforcement learning. (We are inspired by the pioneering work ofÂ DeepMind, who have producedÂ impressiveÂ resultsÂ in this area in the past fewÂ years.)Our projects and fundamental research all have shared cores, so progress on any is likely to benefit the others. Each captures a different aspect of goal-solving, and was chosen for its potential to significantly move ourÂ metric.Weâre just getting started on these projects, and the details may change as we gain additional data. We also expect to add new projects overÂ time.AuthorsIlya SutskeverView all articlesGreg BrockmanView all articlesSam AltmanView all articlesElon MuskView all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
