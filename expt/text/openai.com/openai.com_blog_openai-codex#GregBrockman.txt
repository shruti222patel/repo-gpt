Proficient in more than a dozen programming languages, Codex can now interpret simple commands in natural language and execute them on the userâs behalfâmaking it possible to build a natural language interface to existing applications. We are now inviting businesses and developers to build on top of OpenAI Codex through ourÂ API.Play videoPlay videoPlay videoPlay videoPlay videoPlay videoVideo carousel navigationGo to slide 1Go to slide 2Go to slide 3Go to slide 4Go to slide 5Go to slide 6Creating a Space Game with OpenAI CodexTweetOpenAI Codex is a descendant of GPT-3; its training data contains both natural language and billions of lines of source code from publicly available sources, including code in public GitHub repositories. OpenAI Codex is most capable in Python, but it is also proficient in over a dozen languages including JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift and TypeScript, and even Shell. It has a memory of 14KB for Python code, compared to GPT-3 which has only 4KBâso it can take into account over 3x as much contextual information while performing anyÂ task.GPT-3âs main skill is generating natural language in response to a natural language prompt, meaning the only way it affects the world is through the mind of the reader. OpenAI Codex has much of the natural language understanding of GPT-3, but it produces working codeâmeaning you can issue commands in English to any piece of software with an API. OpenAI Codex empowers computers to better understand peopleâs intent, which can empower everyone to do more withÂ computers.Once a programmer knows what to build, the act of writing code can be thought of as (1) breaking a problem down into simpler problems, and (2) mapping those simple problems to existing code (libraries, APIs, or functions) that already exist. The latter activity is probably the least fun part of programming (and the highest barrier to entry), and itâs where OpenAI Codex excelsÂ most.OpenAI Codex is a general-purpose programming model, meaning that it can be applied to essentially any programming task (though results may vary). Weâve successfully used it for transpilation, explaining code, and refactoring code. But we know weâve only scratched the surface of what can beÂ done.Weâre now making OpenAI Codex available in private beta via our API, and we are aiming to scale up as quickly as we can safely. During the initial period, OpenAI Codex will be offered for free. OpenAI will continue building on the safety groundwork we laid with GPT-3âreviewing applications and incrementally scaling them up while working closely with developers to understand the effect of our technologies in theÂ world.Start using CodexAuthorsWojciech ZarembaView all articlesGreg BrockmanView all articlesOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
