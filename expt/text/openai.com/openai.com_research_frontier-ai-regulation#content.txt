In this paper, we focus on what we term âfrontier AIâ models: highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to stop a modelâs capabilities from proliferating broadly. To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI models. Industry self-regulation is an important first step. However, wider societal discussions and government intervention will be needed to create standards and to ensure compliance with them. We consider several options to this end, including granting enforcement powers to supervisory authorities and licensure regimes for frontier AI models. Finally, we propose an initial set of safety standards. These include conducting pre-deployment risk assessments; external scrutiny of model behavior; using risk assessments to inform deployment decisions; and monitoring and responding to new information about model capabilities and uses post-deployment. We hope this discussion contributes to the broader conversation on how to balance public safety risks and innovation benefits from advances at the frontier of AI development.AcknowledgmentsReport authors, alphabetical orderMarkus Anderljung (Centre for the Governance of AI; Center for a New American Security) *â Joslyn Barnhart (Google DeepMind) **Jade Leung (OpenAI) *Anton Korinek (Brookings Institution; University of Virginia; Centre for the Governance of AI) **â Cullen OâKeefe (OpenAI) *Jess Whittlestone (Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Univeristy of Cambridge) **Report authors, alphabetical orderShahar Avin (Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Univeristy of Cambridge)Miles Brundage (OpenAI)Justin Bullock (University of Washington; Convergence Analysis)Duncan Cass-Beggs (Centre for International Governance Innovation)Ben Chang (The Andrew W.
