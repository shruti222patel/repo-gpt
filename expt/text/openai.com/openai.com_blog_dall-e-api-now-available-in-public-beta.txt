DALLÂ·E excels at following natural language descriptions so users can plainly describe what they want to see. As our research evolves, we will continue to bring the state of the art into the API, including advances in image quality, latency, scalability, andÂ usability.Built-in moderationIncorporating the trust & safety lessons weâve learned while deploying DALLÂ·E to 3 million artists and users worldwide, developers can ship with confidence knowing that built-in mitigationsâlike filters for hate symbols and goreâwill handle the challenging aspects of moderation. As a part of OpenAIâs commitment to responsible deployment, we will continue to make trust & safety a top priority so that developers can focus onÂ building.DALLÂ·E applicationsWeâve worked closely with a few early customers who have already built DALLÂ·E into their apps and products across a variety of useÂ cases.Microsoft BingMicrosoftÂ is bringing DALLÂ·E to a new graphic design app calledÂ Designer, which helps users create professional quality social media posts, invitations, digital postcards, graphics, andÂ more.Microsoft is also integrating DALLÂ·E in Bing and Microsoft Edge with Image Creator, allowing users to create images if web results donât return what theyâre lookingÂ for.CALACALAÂ is the worldâs first fashion and lifestyle operating system.
