This is summed up in the well-worn axiom: âDefense must be correct 100% of the time, attackers only have to be right once.â While it may be true that attackers face fewer constraints and take advantage of their flexibility, defenders have something more valuableâcoordination towards a common goal of keeping people safe.Below are some general project ideas that our team has put forward:Collect and label data from cyber defenders to train defensive cybersecurity agentsDetect and mitigate social engineering tacticsAutomate incident triageÂ Identify security issues in source codeAssist network or device forensicsAutomatically patch vulnerabilitiesOptimize patch management processes to improve prioritization, scheduling, and deployment of security updatesDevelop or improve confidential compute on GPUsCreate honeypots and deception technology to misdirect or trap attackersAssist reverse engineers in creating signatures and behavior based detections of malwareAnalyze an organizationâs security controls and compare to compliance regimesAssist developers to create secure by design and secure by default softwareAssist end users to adopt security best practicesAid security engineers and developers to create robust threat modelsProduce threat intelligence with salient and relevant information for defenders tailored to their organizationHelp developers port code to memory safe languagesApply now!If you share our vision for a secure and innovative AI-driven future, we invite you to submit your proposals and join us in our aim towards enhancing defensive cybersecurity technologies.OpenAI will evaluate and accept applications for funding or other support on a rolling basis. Strong preference will be given to practical applications of AI in defensive cybersecurity (tools, methods, processes). We will grant in increments of $10,000 USD from a fund of $1M USD, in the form of API credits, direct funding and/or equivalents.Offensive-security projects will not be considered for funding at this time.All projects should be intended to be licensed or distributed for maximal public benefit and sharing, and we will prioritize applications that have a clear plan for this.Â Please submit your proposal here.AuthorsBob RotstedView all articlesGirish SastryView all articlesHarold NguyenView all articlesGabriel Bernadett-ShapiroView all articlesJoel ParishView all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
