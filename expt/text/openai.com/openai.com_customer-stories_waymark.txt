GPT-3 helped them consistently produce stronger, more relevant scripts.Simple tools for creating fast, high-quality commercialsSince launching in 2017, Waymark has established itself as the leading platform to create TV commercials and digital video adsâone of the most powerful ways for businesses to introduce their products, services, and events. With an extensive library of professionally-produced templates that anyone can edit, regardless of technical background, Waymark reduces the barriers that prevent so many would-be advertisers from launching successful video campaigns.While Waymark made video creation accessible and easy for anyone, their product research showed that two out of three people still struggled with what to say in those videos. Their copywriters had created industry-based video scripts for top industries, but they often proved too vague and required a lot of customer input. Waymark started to solve this problem with a proprietary script-writing feature, but the results were still too generic for many businesses. As Waymarkâs business grew and their customer base diversified, the challenge only grew more complex.Waymark founder Nathan Labenz was never satisfied with the limitations of the rules-based script-writing feature, and had been hunting for a better solution for years. âOur power users were spending too much time editing scripts, and other users would simply give up altogether. I was committed to getting scriptwriting right, but itâs been a huge challenge,â says Labenz. âIâve tried every AI-powered product available over the last five years, but found nothing that could effectively summarize a businessâs online footprint, let alone write effective marketing copy, until GPT-3.âIâve tried every AI-powered product available over the last five years, but found nothing that could effectively summarize a businessâs online footprint, let alone write effective marketing copy, until GPT-3.Waymark founder Nathan LabenzUsing GPT-3 to create tailored scripts for every customerWaymark uses fine-tuned GPT-3 models to create a qualitatively different script writing experience. After integrating GPT-3, users now receive original, custom scripts for their business in seconds. For Waymark, the evolution from a do-it-yourself to a done-for-you model elevates their mission to make video creation accessible. They now describe themselves as âthe worldâs first natural-language video creation platform.ââIâve been impressed, to say the least,â says Alex Persky-Stern, Waymark CEO. âWe see that customers are spending far less time editing their scripts because Waymark is producing more relevant, accurate, and compelling copy from the beginning. Especially for companies that work with lots of local businesses, this is a dramatic time and cost-saving enhancement that allows them to pitch, sell, and support more local advertisers.âVisit WaymarkResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
