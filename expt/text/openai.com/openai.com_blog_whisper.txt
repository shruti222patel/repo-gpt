Each one has dramatic details, terrific trim, precision paint jobs, plus incredible Micro Machine Pocket Play Sets. Thereâs a police station, fire station, restaurant, service station, and more. Perfect pocket portables to take any place. And there are many miniature play sets to play with, and each one comes with its own special edition Micro Machine vehicle and fun, fantastic features that miraculously move. Raise the boatlift at the airport marina. Man the gun turret at the army base. Clean your car at the car wash. Raise the toll bridge. And these play sets fit together to form a Micro Machine world. Micro Machine Pocket Play Sets, so tremendously tiny, so perfectly precise, so dazzlingly detailed, youâll want to pocket them all. Micro Machines are Micro Machine Pocket Play Sets sold separately from Galoob. The smaller they are, the better they are.Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speechÂ processing.The Whisper architecture is a simple end-to-end approach, implemented as an encoder-decoder Transformer. Input audio is split into 30-second chunks, converted into a log-Mel spectrogram, and then passed into an encoder. A decoder is trained to predict the corresponding text caption, intermixed with special tokens that direct the single model to perform tasks such as language identification, phrase-level timestamps, multilingual speech transcription, and to-English speechÂ translation.Other existing approaches frequently use smaller, more closely paired audio-text training datasets,[^reference-1] [^reference-2][^reference-3] or use broad but unsupervised audio pretraining.[^reference-4][^reference-5][^reference-6]Â Because Whisper was trained on a large and diverse dataset and was not fine-tuned to any specific one, it does not beat models that specialize in LibriSpeech performance, a famously competitive benchmark in speech recognition. However, when we measure Whisperâs zero-shot performance across many diverse datasets we find it is much more robust and makes 50% fewer errors than thoseÂ models.About a third of Whisperâs audio dataset is non-English, and it is alternately given the task of transcribing in the original language or translating to English. We find this approach is particularly effective at learning speech to text translation and outperforms the supervised SOTA on CoVoST2 to English translationÂ zero-shot.We hope Whisperâs high accuracy and ease of use will allow developers to add voice interfaces to a much wider set of applications.
