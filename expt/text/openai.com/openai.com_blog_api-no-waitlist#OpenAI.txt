Since the launch of our API, weâve made deploying applications faster and more streamlined while adding new safety features. Our progress with safeguards makes it possible to remove the waitlist for GPT-3. Starting today, developers inÂ supported countriesÂ canÂ sign upÂ and start experimenting with our API rightÂ away.Improvements to our API over the past year include theÂ Instruct SeriesÂ models that adhere better to human instructions, specialized endpoints for more truthfulÂ question-answering, and a freeÂ content filterÂ to help developers mitigate abuse. Our work also allows us to review applications before theyÂ go live, monitor for misuse, support developers as their product scales, and betterÂ understand the effectsÂ of thisÂ technology.Other changes include an improved Playground, which makes it easy to prototype with our models, anÂ example libraryÂ with dozens of prompts to get developers started, andÂ Codex, a new model that translates natural language intoÂ code.Tens of thousands of developers are already taking advantage of powerful AI models through our platform. We believe that by opening access to these models via an easy-to-use API, more developers will find creative ways to apply AI to a large number of useful applications and openÂ problems.To ensure API-backed applications are built responsibly, we provideÂ toolsÂ and help developers useÂ best practicesÂ so they can bring their applications to production quickly and safely. As our systems evolve and we work to improve the capabilities of our safeguards, we expect to continue streamlining the process for developers, refining ourÂ usage guidelines, and allowing even more use cases overÂ time.As another step in this direction, we are also updating ourÂ content guidelinesÂ to clarify what kind of content our API can be used to generate. Our policies have always prohibited the use of our API in ways that do not adhere to the principles described in ourÂ Charter, and content like hate speech remainsÂ prohibited.To help developers ensure their applications are used for their intended purpose, prevent potential misuse, and adhere to our content guidelines, we offer developers a free content filter. We are currently testing targeted filters for specific content categories with someÂ customers.We are also prohibiting certain types of content on our API, like adult content, where our system is not currently able to reliably discern harmful from acceptable use. We are continually working to make our content filters more robust and we intend to allow acceptable use within some categories as our systemÂ improves.Weâre excited to have the safeguards in place to open up GPT-3 for more developers. As our safeguards continue to improve, we will expand how the API can be used while further improving the experience for our users.Â Sign upÂ today and try itÂ out.API content guidelinesWe prohibit users from knowingly generatingâor allowing others to knowingly generateâthe following categories ofÂ content:HateÂ Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on identity.HarassmentÂ Content that intends to harass, threaten, or bully an individual.ViolenceÂ Content that promotes or glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of others.Self-harmÂ Content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders.AdultÂ Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness).PoliticalÂ Content attempting to influence the political process or to be used for campaigning purposes.SpamÂ Unsolicited bulk content.DeceptionÂ Content that is false or misleading, such as attempting to defraud individuals or spread disinformation.MalwareÂ Content that attempts to generate ransomware, keyloggers, viruses, or other software intended to impose some level of harm.We also work with researchers who are looking to use the API for research or building use-cases to address relatedÂ harms.AuthorsOpenAI View all articlesResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
