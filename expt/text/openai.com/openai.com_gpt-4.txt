GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal evaluations.Safety & alignmentTraining with human feedbackWe incorporated more human feedback, including feedback submitted by ChatGPT users, to improve GPT-4âs behavior. We also worked with over 50 experts for early feedback in domains including AI safety and security.Continuous improvement from real-world useWeâve applied lessons from real-world use of our previous models into GPT-4âs safety research and monitoring system. Like ChatGPT, weâll be updating and improving GPT-4 at a regular cadence as more people use it.GPT-4-assisted safety researchGPT-4âs advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities expedited our safety work. We used GPT-4 to help create training data for model fine-tuning and iterate on classifiers across training, evaluations, and monitoring.Built with GPT-4Weâve collaborated with organizations building innovative products with GPT-4.DuolingoGPT-4 deepens the conversation on Duolingo.Be My EyesBe My Eyes uses GPT-4 to transform visual accessibility.StripeStripe leverages GPT-4 to streamline user experience and combat fraud.Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley wealth management deploys GPT-4 to organize its vast knowledge base.Khan AcademyKhan Academy explores the potential for GPT-4 in a limited pilot program.Government of IcelandHow Iceland is using GPT-4 to preserve its language.More on GPT-4ResearchGPT-4 is the latest milestone in OpenAIâs effort in scaling up deep learning.View GPT-4 researchInfrastructureGPT-4 was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers. Azureâs AI-optimized infrastructure also allows us to deliver GPT-4 to users around the world.LimitationsGPT-4 still has many known limitations that we are working to address, such as social biases, hallucinations, and adversarial prompts. We encourage and facilitate transparency, user education, and wider AI literacy as society adopts these models. We also aim to expand the avenues of input people have in shaping our models.AvailabilityGPT-4 is available on ChatGPT Plus and as an API for developers to build applications and services.Weâre excited to see how people use GPT-4 as we work towards developing technologies that empower everyone.View contributionsTry on ChatGPT PlusView GPT-4 researchResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
