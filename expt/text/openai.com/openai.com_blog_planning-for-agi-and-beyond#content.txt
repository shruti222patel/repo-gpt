Because the upside of AGI is so great, we do not believe it is possible or desirable for society to stop its development forever; instead, society and the developers of AGI have to figure out how to get it right.[^gifts]Although we cannot predict exactly what will happen, and of course our current progress could hit a wall, we can articulate the principles we care aboutÂ most:We want AGI to empower humanity to maximally flourish in the universe. We donât expect the future to be an unqualified utopia, but we want to maximize the good and minimize the bad, and for AGI to be an amplifier ofÂ humanity.We want the benefits of, access to, and governance of AGI to be widely and fairlyÂ shared.We want to successfully navigate massive risks. In confronting these risks, we acknowledge that what seems right in theory often plays out more strangely than expected in practice. We believe we have to continuously learn and adapt by deploying less powerful versions of the technology in order to minimize âone shot to get it rightâÂ scenarios.The short termThere are several things we think are important to do now to prepare forÂ AGI.First, as we create successively more powerful systems, we want to deploy them and gain experience with operating them in the real world. We believe this is the best way to carefully steward AGI into existenceâa gradual transition to a world with AGI is better than a sudden one. We expect powerful AI to make the rate of progress in the world much faster, and we think itâs better to adjust to thisÂ incrementally.A gradual transition gives people, policymakers, and institutions time to understand whatâs happening, personally experience the benefits and downsides of these systems, adapt our economy, and to put regulation in place. It also allows for society and AI to co-evolve, and for people collectively to figure out what they want while the stakes are relativelyÂ low.We currently believe the best way to successfully navigate AI deployment challenges is with a tight feedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration. Society will face major questions about what AI systems are allowed to do, how to combat bias, how to deal with job displacement, and more. The optimal decisions will depend on the path the technology takes, and like any new field, most expert predictions have been wrong so far. This makes planning in a vacuum very difficult.[^planning]Generally speaking, we think more usage of AI in the world will lead to good, and want to promote it (by putting models in our API, open-sourcing them, etc.). We believe that democratized access will also lead to more and better research, decentralized power, more benefits, and a broader set of people contributing newÂ ideas.As our systems get closer to AGI, we are becoming increasingly cautious with the creation and deployment of our models. Our decisions will require much more caution than society usually applies to new technologies, and more caution than many users would like. Some people in the AI field think the risks of AGI (and successor systems) are fictitious; we would be delighted if they turn out to be right, but we are going to operate as if these risks areÂ existential.At some point, the balance between the upsides and downsides of deployments (such as empowering malicious actors, creating social and economic disruptions, and accelerating an unsafe race) could shift, in which case we would significantly change our plans around continuousÂ deployment.As our systems get closer to AGI, we are becoming increasingly cautious with the creation and deployment of our models.Second, we are working towards creating increasingly aligned and steerable models. Our shift from models like the first version of GPT-3 toÂ InstructGPTÂ andÂ ChatGPTÂ is an early example ofÂ this.In particular, we think itâs important that society agree on extremely wide bounds of how AI can be used, but that within those bounds, individual users have a lot of discretion. Our eventual hope is that the institutions of the world agree on what these wide bounds should be; in the shorter term we plan to run experiments for external input. The institutions of the world will need to be strengthened with additional capabilities and experience to be prepared for complex decisions aboutÂ AGI.The âdefault settingâ of our products will likely be quite constrained, but we plan to make it easy for users to change the behavior of the AI theyâre using. We believe in empowering individuals to make their own decisions and the inherent power of diversity ofÂ ideas.We will need to developÂ new alignment techniquesÂ as our models become more powerful (and tests to understand when our current techniques are failing). Our plan in the shorter term is toÂ use AI to help humans evaluateÂ the outputs of more complex models and monitor complex systems, and in the longer term to use AI to help us come up with new ideas for better alignmentÂ techniques.Importantly, we think we often have to make progress on AI safety and capabilities together. Itâs a false dichotomy to talk about them separately; they are correlated in many ways. Our best safety work has come from working with our most capable models. That said, itâs important that the ratio of safety progress to capability progressÂ increases.Third, we hope for a global conversation about three key questions: how to govern these systems, how to fairly distribute the benefits they generate, and how to fairly shareÂ access.In addition to these three areas, we have attempted to set up our structure in a way that aligns our incentives with a good outcome. We haveÂ a clause in our CharterÂ about assisting other organizations to advance safety instead of racing with them in late-stage AGI development. We have a cap on the returns our shareholders can earn so that we arenât incentivized to attempt to capture value without bound and risk deploying something potentially catastrophically dangerous (and of course as a way to share the benefits with society). We have a nonprofit that governs us and lets us operate for the good of humanity (and can override any for-profit interests), including letting us do things like cancel our equity obligations to shareholders if needed for safety and sponsor the worldâs most comprehensive UBIÂ experiment.We have attempted to set up our structure in a way that aligns our incentives with a good outcome.We think itâs important that efforts like ours submit to independent audits before releasing new systems; we will talk about this in more detail later this year. At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models. We think public standards about when an AGI effort should stop a training run, decide a model is safe to release, or pull a model from production use are important. Finally, we think itâs important that major world governments have insight about training runs above a certainÂ scale.The long termWe believe that the future of humanity should be determined by humanity, and that itâs important to share information about progress with the public. There should be great scrutiny of all efforts attempting to build AGI and public consultation for majorÂ decisions.The first AGI will be just a point along the continuum of intelligence. We think itâs likely that progress will continue from there, possibly sustaining the rate of progress weâve seen over the past decade for a long period of time. If this is true, the world could become extremely different from how it is today, and the risks could be extraordinary. A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world; an autocratic regime with a decisive superintelligence lead could do thatÂ too.AI that can accelerate science is a special case worth thinking about, and perhaps more impactful than everything else. Itâs possible that AGI capable enough to accelerate its own progress could cause major changes to happen surprisingly quickly (and even if the transition starts slowly, we expect it to happen pretty quickly in the final stages). We think a slower takeoff is easier to make safe, and coordination among AGI efforts to slow down at critical junctures will likely be important (even in a world where we donât need to do this to solve technical alignment problems, slowing down may be important to give society enough time toÂ adapt).Successfully transitioning to a world with superintelligence is perhaps the most importantâand hopeful, and scaryâproject in human history. Success is far from guaranteed, and the stakes (boundless downside and boundless upside) will hopefully unite all ofÂ us.We can imagine a world in which humanity flourishes to a degree that is probably impossible for any of us to fully visualize yet. We hope to contribute to the world an AGI aligned with suchÂ flourishing.AuthorsSam AltmanView all articlesAcknowledgmentsThanks to Brian Chesky, Paul Christiano, Jack Clark, Holden Karnofsky, Tasha McCauley, Nate Soares, Kevin Scott, Brad Smith, Helen Toner, Allan Dafoe, and the OpenAI team for reviewing drafts of this.ResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewChatGPTGPT-4DALLÂ·E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsAPI data privacyPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
