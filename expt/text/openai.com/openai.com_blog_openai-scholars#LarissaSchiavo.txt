In return, we ask that you document your experiences studying deep learning and hopefully inspire others to do theÂ same.Why weâre doing thisDiversity is core to AI having a positive effect on the worldâitâs necessary to ensure the advanced AI systems in the future are built to benefit everyone. While we hope that some of the scholars will join OpenAI (where we are actively working on internal diversity & inclusion initiatives), we want this program to improve diversity in the field atÂ large.Once youâve decided to join the field, there are many programs (such as ourÂ FellowshipÂ orÂ anyÂ numberÂ ofÂ residencies) which can help you develop your skills. But these require a longer commitment and some existing machine learning experience, and for many people with families or other obligations itâs not possible to simply pack up and come to the BayÂ Area.Resources weâll provideWeâll provide you with aÂ $7.5k/mo stipend for 3 months from June 4, 2018 to August 31,Â 2018.Each scholar will receiveÂ $25,000 worth of credits fromÂ Amazon WebÂ Services.Youâll have a mentor who will provide at least an hour of mentorship via video call each week, answer your questions via chat/email, and work with you to design and execute a good project to stretch yourÂ skills.There will be a group Slack with the scholars and mentors. If youâre in the Bay Area, weâll optionally provide a desk for you at the OpenAIÂ office.Meet the mentorsWeâve lined up the following mentors from OpenAI and the community.

We want to understand why this grant and mentorship will help you achieve something you couldnâtÂ otherwise.Self-motivation & communication.
